## FirefoxOS App - ChangeBadtoGood - Data Timeline

* This is a simple demo built to showcase a firefoxos app consuming json object from http://www.changebadtogood.com
* [live demo](https://marketplace.firefox.com/app/cbtg-issues/) was made available at Firefox marketplace
 
Short geek note:

Basically the method [updateTimeline](https://github.com/spritlesoftware/firefoxos_cbtg_issues_timeline/blob/master/index.html#L201) parses the json data object and display it as timeline.
It's all HTML/JS/CSS.
